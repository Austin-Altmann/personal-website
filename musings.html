					<p id="computer-message">As you can see, I recently acquired a compact SUV's worth of retro computers. As you can imagine, I've now been busy cleaning and restoring a compact SUV's worth of retro computers. I long for the day that my office may be livable again. When it arrives, this section of my website will be graced with detailed technical resources on the restoration of retro computers, as well as some fun observations on the emergence of computer security. Stay tuned, and wish me luck!</p>
